# Training log

Running record of the `TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md` loop. Newest entries at the bottom.

Hyperparameters: `WinPct = 60%`, `MaxHypothesisIterations = 5`, `MaxSolutionsIterations = 5`.

The Gauntlet (loop set): 14 maps × both sides = 28 games per opponent.
`maptestsmall eckleburg intersection colosseum chessboard maze sandwich jellyfish
squer pillars highway fortress valley island_hopping`. A "full" gauntlet run
(all ~75 maps) is the gate before an iteration is declared final.

Infra: builds & games run on GCE VM `battlecode-dev` (Java 8). Current bot lives
in `src/bot/`; accepted iterations are snapshotted to `src/gauntlet/<name>/`.
`tools/gauntlet.sh` runs a Gauntlet; `tools/bc22_replay.py --indicators` reads
the per-round instrumentation strings back out of a replay.

## Iteration 0  —  baseline

**Implementation.** Archons collectively build exactly one Miner (coordinated via
shared-array slot 0), then idle. The Miner moves in a uniformly random direction
each turn. All other unit types idle. Instrumentation: each Archon writes a
per-round `r<n> lead=.. gold=.. myArchons=.. archonHP=.. minerBuilt=..` indicator
string; the Miner writes its location.

Smoke test: `bot` vs `examplefuncsplayer` on `maptestsmall` → lost by Archon
annihilation at round 546 (expected — we build no military).

Gauntlet run pending.
